package "High-Level Processing" as HLP {
    component [Raspberry Pi] as RPI
    component [AI Vision System] as AI
    component [YOLO Detection] as YOLO
    component [Decision Engine] as DE
}

package "Low-Level Control" as LLC {
    component [Arduino Mega] as ARD
    component [Servo Controller] as SERVO
    component [Stepper Driver] as STEPPER
    component [Sensor Interface] as SENSORS
}

package "Hardware Components" as HW {
    component [Robotic Arm (5-DOF)] as ARM
    component [USB Camera] as CAMERA
    component [LD06 LIDAR] as LIDAR
    component [Ultrasonic Sensor] as ULTRA
    component [Power Supply] as POWER
}

RPI --> ARD : Serial USB (9600bps)
AI --> YOLO : Object Detection
YOLO --> DE : Classification Results
DE --> RPI : Control Commands

ARD --> SERVO : PWM Signals
ARD --> STEPPER : STEP/DIR Signals
ARD --> SENSORS : Sensor Readings

SERVO --> ARM : Servo Control
STEPPER --> ARM : Motor Control
SENSORS --> ULTRA : Distance Data
SENSORS --> LIDAR : LIDAR Data

CAMERA --> AI : Video Stream
LIDAR --> AI : Distance Data
POWER --> ARM : Power Supply
POWER --> ARD : Power Supply
POWER --> RPI : Power Supply

DISPLAY --> RPI : Visual Output
KEYBOARD --> RPI : User Input
MONITOR --> ARD : Debug Output

note right of RPI : Handles AI processing,\nobject detection,\ndecision making
note right of ARD : Manages real-time\nhardware control,\nsensor reading
note right of AI : Processes camera\nand LIDAR data\nfor object recognition
